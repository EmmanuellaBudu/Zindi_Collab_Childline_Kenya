# Zindi_Collab_Childline_Kenya
Team thinkingface working on the third Zindi Mentorship challenge.

## Structure:

- data: contains the data from Zindi as it is provided
- eda: Different explorations of the data by our team members
- feature_engineering: contains code to transform the raw data in 'data/' and generate modified train and test CSVs for use in modelling
- images: Pictures to use in notebooks or the readme
- model: contains a starter model (catboost) that can be used to benchmark different features and see if they are useful. Will also host modelling notebooks from each team member that can be run to generate a submission. We can ensemble the submissions in the final step.

## Tracking
